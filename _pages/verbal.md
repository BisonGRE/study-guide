My golden rules for the GRE verbal is this: find evidence in the question for every answer you pick. Never use outside knowledge to pick an answer. Once I understood this, I felt like an idiot. Chatgpt performs really well at verbal questions for this reason, because it attentively matches every detail in the question to the answer choices. It's less like thinking and more like listening. Keeping this rule in mind, here's what I did for verbal;

### Verbal Basics:
Everybody says start your verbal preparation with memorizing vocabulary, and in this case they're right!

1. <b>Vocabulary:</b> The two most commonly used vocabulary lists are Magoosh's 1000 words list and Gregmat's 980 words list. There are also other lists such as Manhattan, Prep Scholar, etc. Personally, I filtered for words that are common to 2 or more lists and compiled my own list. You can use my 1300-word list by copying my google sheet. The MOST IMPORTANT thing is to memorize 20-30 words everyday and REVISE yesterday's words.

2. <b>Reading:</b> Reading college-level books/articles is extremely important to succeed in the verbal section. Go for longform articles from reputed sources like the New York TImes, Aeon, Economist and even wikipedia entries about anything that interests you. The important part is to develop a habit of reading dense text and quickly deciphering the meaning. GRE passages tend to feature scientific content, so I would recommend picking up an science-oriented book geared towards laymen, for example; Sapiens, Cosmos, A brief history of time, etc.

3. <b>Practice:</b> Official Verbal practice questions. Verbal questions from other sources can rarely be trusted. Do ALL of these before trying anything else. 

4. <b>TC/SE Strategies:</b> The first strategy you should employ is to answer every question using information from only the question itself. Basically, make a practice of evaluating whether the quesetion <i>provides evidence</i> for an option to be true. NEVER answer a question using your outside knowledge, those are usually traps. After this one, if there's one other strategy you need, it's the gregmat Math strategy. Although instead of putting words in an equation, I phrase them as opposing. But same core idea; contrast is the clue to many questions on the GRE. Take these two concepts to heart and practice using them when trying verbal questions from the official verbal questions.

5. <b>Passage strategies:</b> Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPvWRYPadFg&pp=ygUZdGVzdGVkIHR1dG9yIGdyZSBwYXNzYWdlcw%3D%3D) by TestedTutor. My approach to passages was similar to his, I quickly scanned the questions first (only question titles, NOT the answer choices), then began reading. When reading, I read the first few lines very slowly and <b> try to visualize </b> each phrase as it adds to the previous. After I totally understand the first few lines, I speed up and skim through. Here I apply another strategy; simplified reading. Basically, I read a simpler version of the text, skipping over names, jargon and descriptions. When I finish a passage, I quickly summarize in my head how it connects to the previous passage. This improves my comprehension speed dramatically. I barely get passage questions wrong using this. Practice this if you want to level up your passage game, but ultimately go for the process that you like best, whether it be slow-reading, skipping the large passage, answers-first, or any other passage strategy. Try things out.

### More verbal:
At this point, you should do a careful evaluation of your error log. Proceed based on your findings;

+ <b>Passages:</b> What if I told you that you could finish passage questions so fast that you'll be sitting around and waiting for the test to finish? That is infact very doable with the GRE verbal section, simply by increasing your reading speed. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwEquW_Yij0&pp=ygUOc3BlZWQgcmVhZGluZyA%3D) shows different speed reading techniques like reducing subvocalization, cursor method, etc. Use what works well for you, don't go for every method at once. Afterwards, I recommend practicing reading large passages using this [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/swiftread-read-faster-lea/ipikiaejjblmdopojhpejjmbedhlibno). The goal is to get to a point where you can quickly skim through passages and understand the purpose of every line (Without having to understand every detail about the lines themselves)

+ Vocab: If a limited vocabulary is forcing you to make mistakes, then it's time to get very serious about finishing that list. I personally used chatgpt to help me learn. I wrote a script that narrowed down the list to words I still coudn't learn, then put them through chatgpt API to get meanings, mnemonics and usage examples. I still have the script and provide this service to my students, email me if you want it for free. Also, find a way to use those words. I know, sounds dumb but it's doable. Use a study buddy or a study group if that's less embarassing, but use them in conversation.

+ Attention: For me, this was the biggest hurdle to a good verbal score. I realized that most of my mistakes were happening because I couldn't apply consistent focus across all questions throughout a whole test. Refer to the focus section for more on this issue.

+ <b>Practice:</b> The big problem with practicing verbal questions is that nothing other than the Official ETS materials are reliable. I've gone through practice questions from Manhattan, Kaplan, Magoosh, etc and found none of them to be completely represantative of the actual <i>style of reasoning</i> that the real GRE questions test. Instead, I recommend going back to the GRE big book once you are finished with the Official Guide. Practice questions from similar to the ones you get wrong. Don't worry about timing yourself when you are practicing. Improve your reading speed separately and save timed practice for the mocks. The reason is that you need to be able to answer the questions first before you work on speeding up the process.

### Quant Basics:
Starting your Quant prep from scratch can feel daunting, especially if you're revisiting math after a long break. When starting out, make the best of your time by focusing on the official materials:

1. <b>ETS Math Review Guide:</b> Perfect for brushing up on all the necessary math skills required for the GRE. It covers topics from arithmetic to data analysis. Use this guide to refresh your memory on key concepts and to practice applying these concepts through its exercise sections.

2. <b>Official Quant Practice Questions:</b> Finish this and notice your strengths and weaknesses.

3. <b><i>(Optional)</i> Manhattan 5lb Book:</b> This book is good for drilling specific quant topics if you are particularly weak in the quant section. Each chapter focuses on a different area. Focus on areas where you have made many mistakes in the Official Quant Practice Questions. For each topic, practice until you get 3-5 right in a row.

3. <b> Gregmat math:</b> Gregmat already has quant practice questions. However, questions are often harder than those in the actual gre, this comes with the benefit of truly having your bases covered. You'd be wasting time with the hard/extreme ones unless you want a 330+ score, in which case go for it.

### More Quant:
1. <b>Gregmat topic-based practice:</b> Go on gregmat quant practice, select the first tag and deselect everything else. Practice a topic until you start getting 5 right in a row. Then practice some more with only Hard and Extreme difficulty. 

2. <b>Gregmat quant flashcards:</b> Before you start a new topic, use gregmat flashcards to brush up on topics. Familiarize yourself with these flascards so you can easily revise just by looking at them. I narrowed down my main problem areas and looked at those specific flashcards on the day of the exam. They helped my confidence. And in math, confidence is king.

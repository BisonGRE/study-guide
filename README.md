Hi I'm Qavi. I sat for the shorter GRE in 2023 and got a 337 (Quant: 170, Verbal: 167, Writing: 5.0)

My prep was informed by random online resources such as this one. Which is why I wrote this, to hopefully contribute to others like me. However, I also became deeply invested in figuring out the GRE, and decided to share my knowledge through tutoring and mentoring their GRE journey. If you want to know more, checkout the Tutoring section.

# How to use this guide
First read the guide in full and then gather the required resources. All tasks are written in the order I completed them (for the most part). Both quant and verbal have a basic section that will introduce all concepts that will be tested on the GRE. Completing this section alone should be enough to get a score in the 320-325 range. However, that does not factor in "silly mistakes", which refers to making mistakes despite knowing the solution. As you practice and track your errors, silly mistakes can be significantly reduced. Refer to the required resources section to get the sheet I used. When you have everything, start tackling the resources. You should allocate at least two months to finish everything in this guide. 

## Required resources
+ Official GRE guidebooks for both quant and verbal
+ Official GRE practice questions for verbal
+ Gregmat subscription
+ Official 5 powerprep mocks, plus 3-4 other mocks from either Manhattan or Magoosh
+ Error tracking sheet (read below and [download here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UbQH1rYQDByBalAASH91J5ml8uuFxzG98Hc5GAgzlj4/edit?usp=sharing))
+ My 1300 word list ([download here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xfIHA0D-AfwCCVgnnoI_i0UGQoi_49bU/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100042368294756028201&rtpof=true&sd=true))

## Mocks
Mocks form the bedrock of your preparation schedule. I sat for 8 mocks. 5 of those are real ETS mocks (2 Powerprep mocks and 3 powerprep plus mocks). I recommend giving one mock each week, then spending a day just going over all the marked and incorrect questions (BE SURE to mark any questions you are confused about while giving the mock!!). You will then use your mistakes to create your best resource; the error log.

## Error tracking sheet:
Your error log is your best chance at improving your score. I recommend only tracking errors from ETS questions and mocks. Your log should have:

+ Detailed listings: Copy and paste the entire question into your spreadsheet. Trust me, this will come in handy later.

+ Identify cause of error: Write down where you went wrong and why. Was it a silly mistake, a conceptual misunderstanding, or a misreading of the question?

+ What could you have done differently: Write down what concept/method could have solved the question properly?

+ Analyzing Patterns: Over time, review your log to add categories to your errors. Are there specific topics where you make more errors? This can direct your study efforts more effectively. For example, categories in quant may include; question-misread, calculation-error, etc.

+ Refining Study Plan: Use your log to inform your study plan. Figure out what exactly you are doing that's making you repeat the same mistakes. Dig deep and you'll be rewarded. When I started out, I couldn't imagine getting to a point where I wouldn't make a single silly mistake in the whole test. But ultimately, that's exactly what happened.

## Rinse and repeat
When you get your error log, go back to practicing as the guide recommends. Use your error log where prompted. Read the focus section and follow the advice as you immerse yourself in a sea of vocab and math. Seriously, obsess over all things GRE. Eventually, your brain will get better and better at solving GRE problems and you will reach your desired score. Now stop reading plans and solving problems!

All the best in your journey.

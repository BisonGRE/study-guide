Many students who sit for the GRE are busy people. Even when they have all the resources at their disposal, they struggle to consistently study and practice. On top of that, prepping for the GRE in 2024 is like managing your own research project. There's different materials recommended for different sections, there's tracking your errors and adapting your study plan. Then there's analyzing your mock results and developing realistic time estimates and goals. All of these tasks create extra cognitive overhead for students that distracts them from problem-solving to their brain's full capacity.

To address these problems, I offer fully-managed GRE preparation both for 1-on-1 and cohort style tutoring. Here's the breakdown when compared to tutoring;

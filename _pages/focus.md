The GRE doesn’t just test your knowledge; it examines your ability to focus under pressure. Every question is a puzzle requiring not just understanding but also quick, precise thinking.

Focus is the brain's way of zeroing in on a specific task, dismissing irrelevant information. It's a finite resource that can be exhausted by both internal and external distractions. Focus can also be depleted by using it continuously, such as while during a long test like the GRE. If you are like me, and you don't have a healthy lifestyle or exercise much, then studying for the GRE would be like running a marathon on heels. After all, if you can get something right once, then you have it in you to get it right everytime. It's just a matter of figuring out how to maintain your brain's ability to focus equally throughout the test. The importance of this part will become clearer once you start logging and categorizing your errors. 

So how do you train your brain to focus harder and for longer?

### Sleep: 

It all starts with sleep. You need both quantity (8+ hours a day) and quality. Poor quality sleep leads to mental fatigue and lowered focus.

### Time of day:
Your brain's capacity fluctuates during the day. You need to figure out when your brain is at peak capacity. It helps to align with your natural circadian rhythms. If you're a night owl, your brain will hit peak capacity sometime in the evening or early morning if you are a morning lark. Pick your best time and register for the test <b>at that same time</b>. Then when you practice or give a mock, do it at that same time as well. Synchronizing your study schedule to your peak alertness times can dramatically improve your absorption and focus capacities.

### Diet:
The brain consumes about 20% of your body’s energy—what you eat significantly impacts cognitive functions, including focus and memory. Here’s how to nourish your brain for peak test performance:

+ Eat low Glycemic Foods: Avoid sugar. Especially before studying or testing. This is because they will cause blood-glucose spikes. Foods like bananas provide a stable energy release, enhancing focus without the crash that follows high-sugar snacks.

+ Zinc-Rich Foods: Zinc is crucial for cognitive stability and focus. Include foods like mutton, beef, pumpkin, and nuts in your diet.

+ Meal Size: Large meals divert blood to the stomach for digestion, reducing the energy available to your brain. Conversely, hunger can distract you. Strike a  balance to keep your brain well-fueled without getting full.

On test days, opt for meals that boost sustained energy release without overstimulating your brain, like those rich in proteins and low-glycemic index carbohydrates. Avoid high-sugar foods that might lead to energy spikes and crashes.

### Hormones and Neurotransmitters:

1. Acetylcholine: This neurotransmitter is vital for focus and can be bolstered by consuming eggs and milk. Exercise also enhances its production.
2. Dopamine: Known as the 'motivation molecule,' dopamine levels can be naturally boosted through rewarding activities like exercise, ensuring your brain is ready to engage and solve problems efficiently.

### Meditation:
Though I didn’t use meditation personally, numerous studies validate its effectiveness in enhancing concentration, reducing anxiety, and improving memory—all crucial for mastering the GRE.

### Summary:

How does this all translate into GRE prep? Basically try to stick to the following for the months leading up to your exam:

1. Sleep Well: Align your sleep schedule to ensure you're well-rested for each study session.
2. Do eat: Low-glycemic and zinc-rich foods.
3. Don't eat: Everything sugary
4. Exercise: Anything works, running, swimming or even going for walks help
4. Before the test: Eat enough to not be hungry, but not until you're full. Eat low-glycemic food like bananas. Keep sufficient water nearby. Spend the last 24 hours just relaxing your nervous system.

To me, mastering the GRE was as much about understanding how to learn and focus as it is about the content itself. By managing your biological needs effectively, you can ensure that every study session moves you closer to your target score.
